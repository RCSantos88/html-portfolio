<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Programing has always been an interesting subject to me. I started programming a few years ago as part of the University Lectures that I was attending.
  I have learned and worked with different tools in order to develop the projects that were assigned, but never web development.
</p>

<p>My academic background is Biomedical Engineering.</p>

<p>I have always been eager to learn new skills, my tech hobbies are 3D printing and electronics.
  I am now learning Web Development!
